I have tweaked quite a few things here and there in the hope of making the content clearer.

The code in II-operators/1-double.ts is taken from https://benlesh.com/posts/rxjs-operators-in-depth-part-1/

# Organisation of code examples
in I-learning-by-building and II-operators, we rebuild the RxJS library from scratch without relying in any way on RxJS.

Starting from III-unsubscriptions, we use RxJS.
